# Text File Writer
A simple Java solution that creates and writes to a text file. The project contains two concrete classes for this task. TextfileOverwriter and TextfileAppender that contains static methods for over-writing or append text in a text file. Both classes will automatically create the text file if it does not exist.

<h2>Installation</h2>
Compile the project - Generate a jar library - Add the jar to the project's build path - Instantiate either or both classes as needed.

<h2>Motivation</h2>
I needed a library that would allow me to write a report or anything else to a text file as needed.

<h2>Info</h2>
There aren't any test cases for this project.
